# hello-world
Damage has defined our border
All that matter forged in flame
Knowing little of your wounding
Share our mending all the same
Weight of words and wars we carried
I'm like you, just like you
Eyes of secret and storm and story
But shared, and well, we'll make it through
Sadness like a pendulum
Pulls us round and to and fro
Onus Fate and Undo Odium
Armor, anchor, lead and stone
By the telling let them become
Will they all be feathers?
Eyes of secret storm and story
Show and tell, we'll make it through
Onus Fate and Undo Odium
Armor, anchor, lead and stone
By the telling
may they become
May they all be feathers
